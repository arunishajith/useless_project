### Project Description
The Game Hub is a one-stop platform featuring three classic games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock Paper Scissors, and Snake. Users can enjoy each game with a simple click!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever feel overwhelmed by having to open separate tabs to play different games? Well, we solved the non-existent issue of "too many clicks to have fun"!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've packed all three games into a single hub, so you can switch between them with zero hassleâ€”because why not?
